# Slave---Music-Player

Version 2.0 Created 6/5/17 by PJ Valentini

This Music Player is still in development.

This Slave Music Player works with Soundcloud API
      * Play, pause, prev, next buttons are all working (shuffle, volume control
      and mute buttons will be added later).

      * Functionality to Soundcloud API is working.
        - can play one track off of a search, and play songs off the playlist.  Clicking a track on the playlist or clicking next or previous buttons can play a track as well

      * Minor CSS upgrades from Version 1.0 6/19/17

      * Album art now displays depending on the track.
      * Still need to fix the volume control, song and artist data under the
      * Album art and progress bar / duration.
